- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jojo970, I am an aspiring Data Scientist who has decided to take the route of becoming a data analyst first. I have a passion for data driven decisions and would love to contribute to your data projects!

Ever since, I have been making tons of projects on the things I'm interested in...
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, Blockchains, data science and using all of the above for trading more efficiently!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Solidity, and having too much fun on that
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any and all projects! I love to learn all this so feel free to reach out to me!
