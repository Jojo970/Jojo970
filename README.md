- 👋 Hi, my name is Jong Lee. I am a Full Stack Developer seeking full time employement at the moment. I started my coding journey in 2021 with Python and decided to expand my skillset to the MERN stack in 2022!

Ever since, I have been making tons of projects on the things I'm interested in...
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, Blockchains, data science and using all of the above for trading more efficiently!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Solidity, and having too much fun on that
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any and all projects! I love to learn all this so feel free to reach out to me!
