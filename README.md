- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jojo970, I am a college drop out... just hear me out....
I was majoring in Psychology and studying to be a clinical social worker,
but I decided that I wanted to learn to code instead.
Ever since, I have been making tons of projects on the things I'm interested in...
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, Blockchains, data science and using all of the above for trading more efficiently!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Solidity, and having too much fun on that
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any and all projects! I love to learn all this so feel free to reach out to me!
