- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, my name is Jong Lee. I am a Full Stack Developer. I started my coding journey in 2021 with Python and decided to expand my skillset to the MERN stack in 2022!

Ever since, I have been making tons of projects on the things I'm interested in...
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Python, Blockchains, data science and using all of the above for trading more efficiently!
- ðŸ‘€ I love creating visualy pleasing UIs and working on minimalistic themes.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working to learn Rust and more about React.
